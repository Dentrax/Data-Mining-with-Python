## What It Is

**Data Mining with Python**

Data-Mining-with-Python guide contains DataMining examples and practices made with the Python language. Easy and advanced way to learn Data Mining practices.

**Who is the target audience?**

This course is meant for anyone who wants to start Data Mining in Python. It starts from the basic concepts of each technology, so user's experienced in a particular area will be able to speed through these sections. 

* Warning : This course assumes you have some Python knowledge, and `does not teach Python itself.`

* Warning : These example tutorials are not a "How to Data Mine" or "How data mining works" and will not teach "Data mining techniques"

**Why Phyton**

1. `Python` is easy to use, powerful, and versatile, making it a great choice for beginners and experts alike.

2. `Python's` readability makes it a great first programming language — it allows you to think like a programmer and not waste time understanding the mysterious syntax that other programming languages can require.

## About

Data-Mining-with-Python was created to serve three purposes:

**Data-Mining-with-Python is a basically Data-Structures learning repository which all structures coded in Go language**

1. To act as a guide to learn basic Data Structures with enhanced and rich content.

2. To provide a simplest and easiest way to learn. 

3. There is no any Data Structures guide coded in Go language on the internet.
