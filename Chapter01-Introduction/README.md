## Pandas

**About**

`Pandas` is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way toward this goal.

1. Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet

2. Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data

3. Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels

4. Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure

**About**

`NumPy` is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

1. A powerful N-dimensional array object

2. Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions

3. Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code

4. Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

## SciPy

**About**

`SciPy` library depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation. The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization. Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are quick to install, and are free of charge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the world’s leading scientists and engineers. If you need to manipulate numbers on a computer and display or publish the results, Scipy is the tool for the job.

Refers to several related but distinct entities:

1. The SciPy ecosystem, a collection of open source software for scientific computing in Python

2. The community of people who use and develop this stack

3. Several conferences dedicated to scientific computing in Python - SciPy, EuroSciPy and SciPy.in

4. The SciPy library, one component of the SciPy stack, providing many numerical routines

**About**

`Matplotlib` is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell, the jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.

**About**

`IPython` is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language, that offers enhanced introspection, rich media, additional shell syntax, tab completion, and rich history. IPython currently provides the following features:

1. Powerful interactive shells (terminal and Qt-based)

2. A browser-based notebook with support for code, text, mathematical expressions, inline plots and other rich media

3. Support for interactive data visualization and use of GUI toolkits

4. Flexible, embeddable interpreters to load into one’s own projects

5. Easy to use, high performance tools for parallel computing

**About**

`Scikit-learn` (formerly scikits.learn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

1. Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis

2. Accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts

3. Built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib

4. Open source, commercially usable - BSD license

**About**

`statsmodels` is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. An extensive list of result statistics are available for each estimator. The results are tested against existing statistical packages to ensure that they are correct.

1. Linear regression models

2. Mixed Linear Model with mixed effects and variance components

3. Generalized linear models with support for all of the one-parameter exponential family distributions

4. Generalized Estimating Equations for one-way clustered or longitudinal data
